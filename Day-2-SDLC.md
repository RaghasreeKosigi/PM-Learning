Product Managers don’t need to memorize full SDLC theory — they must understand what matters for managing product delivery.
Here are the exact industry-relevant points for PMs.

1. Why PMs Need SDLC Knowledge
To understand how ideas become real products.

To plan timelines based on model type.

To coordinate with engineering, QA, and design.

To choose the right model depending on product maturity.

2. SDLC Models — PM-Relevant Summary Table
Model	When PM Uses It	Why It’s Important
Waterfall	Clear requirements, no changes expected	Helps estimate timelines & fixed deliverables
Agile	Evolving product, iterative releases	PM works closely with dev team in sprints
Scrum	Fast-paced teams	PM (Product Owner) manages backlog & prioritization
Kanban	Continuous flow of tasks	Helps PM track progress & bottlenecks
V-Model	Critical systems (banking/healthcare)	Understanding testing alignment
